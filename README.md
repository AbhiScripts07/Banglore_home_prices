## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this analysis is to explore the real estate market in Bangalore and build a predictive model for home prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

## 2. Data Description
The dataset contains information about homes sold in Bangalore, including:
- Location
- Size (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Price

## 3. Data Preprocessing
In this section, the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section visualizes the relationships between different features and home prices:
- Scatter plots for price vs size
- Box plots for price distribution across different locations

## 5. Modeling
Various regression models are applied to predict home prices:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and RÂ² score.

## 6. Results
The results section summarizes the findings from the models, including which features are most significant in predicting home prices.

## 7. Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the Bangalore real estate market and highlights key factors that influence home pricing.
